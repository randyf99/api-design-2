GRAPHQL Vs REST

graphql
- One route
- Not based on HTTP verbs
- Strict data typing
- interactive docs
- Works well with a component architecture
- Advanced data resolving

REST
- Many routes
- Based on HTTP verbs
- Cacheable on a network level

Final Node.JS Project
- You should have a dataset to work with (recommend the mongodb datsets)
- REST API using express, mongoose
- You need to implement CRUD 
- Once completed, you need to implement the front-end
- The front-end must implement full CRUD.
- This is due: Sunday the 19th at midnight. NO EXCEPTIONS!! If not complete, turn in what you have.
